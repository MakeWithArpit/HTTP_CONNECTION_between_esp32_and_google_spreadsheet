# HTTP_CONNECTION_between_esp32_and_google_spreadsheet

üì° ESP32 to Google Spreadsheet using HTTP (GET & POST)
This repository demonstrates how to send and receive data between an ESP32 and Google Sheets using the HTTP protocol. With the help of Google Apps Script and ESP32‚Äôs WiFi capabilities, you can easily integrate real-time data logging and retrieval with your spreadsheet.

üìÅ Repository Structure
The project is organized into three folders:

1. GET_Function

This folder contains:
  Google Apps Script code (for handling GET requests).
  ESP32 Arduino code.

Purpose:
  Fetch data from a Google Spreadsheet and store it into a variable on the ESP32. Useful for reading configuration values or other inputs from the cloud.

2. POST_Function

This folder contains:
  Google Apps Script code (for handling POST requests).
  ESP32 Arduino code.

Purpose:
  Send data from the ESP32 to a Google Spreadsheet. Ideal for logging sensor data, device events, or status updates.

3. GET_and_POST_Combined

This folder contains:
  A single Google Apps Script (capable of handling both GET and POST)
  A single ESP32 code file (combining both GET and POST operations)

Purpose:
Implement both data upload and fetch functionalities within a single ESP32 sketch, reducing complexity and enhancing project scalability. Great for IoT systems that require two-way communication with Google Sheets.

üîß Key Features

  Uses ESP32‚Äôs built-in HTTPClient library
  No third-party platforms required (Google Apps Script only)
  Fully customizable and open-source
  Simple structure with practical use cases

üöÄ Getting Started

Each folder includes clearly documented code and instructions to help you:

Set up Google Apps Script as a web app.
Configure your ESP32 with WiFi and HTTP functionality.
Easily test GET and POST interactions with Google Sheets.
